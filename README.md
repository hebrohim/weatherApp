## Overview
This is a web application to show a weather forecast using weather API from external services like https://openweathermap.org/.It allows users to be able to search for a specific location by city name and display the weather condotion in celcius.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- search weather condition of a specific location
- search weather condition by city Name
- see current Time of user's location
- see weather description

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS flexBox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Api calls

### What I learned
I learnt how to effectively call an Api from external resources like https://openweathermap.org/. I also was able to use the fetch and catch method to collect data from an Api and throw back error when there's a problem while retrieving the data
### Continued development
I will like to improve on this app by allowing it to auto generate the location of the user and bring out the weather forcast for the user location at that particular time.
