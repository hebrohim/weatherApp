## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid in css effectively. compare to flexbox, i was able to make changes to my rows and columns at the same time making use of properties like 
-grid area
-grid gap
-grid-template-row
-grid-template-column

### Continued development

i still want to improve more on my mobile-first approach for designing.with the help of grid system in css i was able to design this project with the mobile first technique. I hope to use bootstrsp or tailwind Css for my next project

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me when i got stuck while using my grid-area

After teaching my student flexbox and grid system in css, i thought of a good project we could implement with grid system, I quickly designed this project and allow them work on it too.
